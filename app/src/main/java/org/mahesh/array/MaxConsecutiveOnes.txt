Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Note:

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

Complexity Analysis of solution 2

Time Complexity: O(N)O(N), where NN is the number of elements in the array.

Space Complexity: O(1)O(1). We do not use any extra space.
